# Mobile Robotics Fall23
## Line-Follower-Robot
**Aim:** Use ROS to program a TurtleBot to traverse a curved red tape line. The robot should move in random directions once it looses track of the red tape line until it finds a new line to follow.    
**Notes:** The robot plays the built-in "ON" sound once it finds a red tape line to follow and enters the forward state. The robot plays the buit-in "OFF" sound once it changes state to random motion.
